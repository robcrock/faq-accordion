## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### What I learned

I hadn't appreciate the benefits of bring the ShadUI components into my repo before, but it's great having full control over that code. At first, I was trying to work with them as I would another UI library like MUI or Chakra, but with Shadcn/UI all the code is in your repo and it's just React styled with Tailwind. Another big win of using the stack I did was the ease of make the accordion accessible. That would have take much longer to do if I was leveraging Shadcn/UI.
